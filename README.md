This is an example app of how to build a leaderboard using the WordPress.com API.

### How It Works

This leaderboard keeps track of how many times a user posts to a given blog, and how many issues they create in a GitHub repository labeled as "bug".

### Deploy & Hosting

You will need a WordPress.com site and associated bearer token to run the code.  Both of these should be configured in `config.js`.  You can then run the code locally or any host that supports node.js apps.

### TODO

- Look at caching the api responses that build the leaderboard, it is sloooow currently
- eat a steak with snoop lion
- find more things that sound like chewbacca IRL
